bash scripts to backup a nextcloud server and piwigo server on linux ubuntu

The backup is done dayly with BorgBackup on a local folder on the server.
I use rclose to sync this folder to BackBlaze and have a last resource copy on the cloud.

There is also a manual backup that is done once a week to a USB drive.
